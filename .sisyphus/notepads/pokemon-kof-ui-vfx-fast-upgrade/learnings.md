- 2026-02-12: `ColorRect` and `CPUParticles2D` (square shape) are sufficient for prototyping "Anime Arena" atmosphere without external textures.
- 2026-02-12: Centralized visual management (`ArenaAtmosphere.gd`) that injects nodes into specific layers (`BackgroundLayer`, `FighterLayer`, `VfxLayer`) provides better separation of concerns than monolithic `BattleScreen`.
- 2026-02-12: Preserving legacy coordinate systems (by matching Control anchors/offsets) is critical when refactoring UI hierarchy to avoid breaking gameplay logic (fighter movement limits).
- 2026-02-12: Implemented "Anime Arena" banner style using code-only `Tween` sequences for text scaling (elastic slam) and background strip expansion, avoiding external assets.
- 2026-02-12: Centralized banner visibility management into `_show_banner` and `_hide_banner` ensures consistent state reset between rounds and matches.
- 2026-02-12: Deterministic hit-feedback validation is easier when the presentation pipeline exposes explicit counters (`total_hits`, `spark_count`, `flash_count`, `shake_count`, `hit_stop_count`) consumed by QA scripts.
- 2026-02-12: Camera-shake and hit-stop can stay presentation-only by applying offsets/overlay cues on `FighterLayer` + `VfxLayer` + `OverlayLayer`, without touching combat rule scripts.
