- 2026-02-12: Decision: Implement `ArenaAtmosphere` as a code-driven node generator instead of a static `.tscn` file to avoid manual scene file editing errors and ensure dynamic layer injection.
- 2026-02-12: Decision: Use `CPUParticles2D` for foreground atmosphere (dust motes) instead of a Shader to maximize compatibility and minimize asset dependencies.
- 2026-02-12: Decision: Keep `arena_overlay` geometry identical to legacy `arena` rect to avoid rewriting fighter movement constraints in `_unhandled_input`.
- 2026-02-12: Decision: Refactored `_show_banner` to handle both text and a new background `ColorRect` to create a cinematic strip effect for Round/Fight events.
- 2026-02-12: Decision: Use `Tween` with `TRANS_ELASTIC` for text entrance to simulate high-impact "slam" effect common in fighting games.
- 2026-02-12: Decision: Added `HitFeedbackPipeline` as a dedicated presentation node (`scripts/visuals/hit_feedback_pipeline.gd`) and routed `battle_screen.gd::_flash_target` through it to centralize spark/flash/shake/hit-stop behavior.
- 2026-02-12: Decision: Implemented deterministic QA contract in `qa/qa_hit_feedback_pipeline.gd` using pipeline counters and ratio token output (`HIT_TO_VFX_RATIO:%.2f`) to keep headless verification machine-checkable.
